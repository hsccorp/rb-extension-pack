PDF Review Extension
====================

Overview
--------

This extension provides support for reviewing PDF documents. Users can convert
their word/ppt etc documents to PDF and use this extension for reviews.

The extension uses [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) from Mozilla for rendering the PDF pages in browser.
The functionality is similar to Image review feature provided by ReviewBoard except the diff viewer. Instead it provides an option to view different revisions of the document.

This extension requires ReviewBoard 2.5 or higher.
